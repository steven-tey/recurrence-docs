# Features

Here are some of the features on Recurrence:

## Powerful Tracking 🔗
By employing the use of both cookie-tracking and cookieless-tracking, Recurrence is able to give a holistic snapshot of every click/purchase that you receive via your affiliate network, making sure that every sale is accurately attributed to the rightful affiliate.

## Email Notifications 📨
You can customize your nofiications settings and choose to receive email notificaations for every click/purchase made via your affiliates' links.

## No Setup Fee 💰
Unlike other affiliate management platforms that charge a hefty non-refundable fee to get your program set up, Recurrence doesn't charge a setup fee – we only take a small cut from every sale you make via your affiliates.

## Developer-Friendly 👨‍💻
Our API is incredibly easy to set up (literally a single `<script>` tag in the `<head>` section of your HTML), but if you run into any issues, we have extensive documentation to make sure you never get stuck.

## Lightweight Script 🚅
Our tracking script is less than 1KB in size and is delivered via Cloudflare's CDN, allowing your site to load much faster, ensuring the best user experience for your affiliates and customers.

## Privacy-Focused 🔐
Recurrence is aware of various privacy concerns that your users might have and will never keep any personally-identifiable information of your users.
